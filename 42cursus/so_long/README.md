##  üìê  Introduction

‚Ä¢ Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.

‚Ä¢ Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

‚Ä¢ All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated.

‚Ä¢ If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

‚Ä¢ Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

‚Ä¢ To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h}.
Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.

‚Ä¢ If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project‚Äôs
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

‚Ä¢ We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won‚Äôt have to be submitted and won‚Äôt be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers‚Äô work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

‚Ä¢ Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded.
If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought‚Äôs grading, the evaluation will stop.

## üíæ Mandatory part

|**Program name**|so\_long|
| - | - |
|**Turn in files**|Makefile, \*.h, \*.c, maps|
|**Makefile**|NAME, all, clean, fclean, re|
|**Arguments**|A map in format \*.ber|
|**External functs.**|<p>- open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit</p><p>- All functions of the math library (-lm compiler option, man man 3 math)</p><p>- All functions of the MiniLibX</p><p>- ft\_printf and any equivalent YOU coded</p>|
|**Libft authorized**|Yes|
|**Description**|<p>You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of</p><p>a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any character, any collectible and any place you want.</p>|
Your project must comply with the following rules:

- You **must** use the MiniLibX. Either the version available on the school machines, or installing it using its sources.
- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not relink.
- Your program has to take as parameter a map description file ending with the .ber extension.

**1 Game**

- The player‚Äôs goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route.
- The W, A, S, and Dkeys must be used to move the main character.
- The player should be able to move in these **4 directions**: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current **number of movements** must be displayed in the shell.
- You have to use a **2D view** (top-down or profile).
- The game doesn‚Äôt have to be real time.
- Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you want.

**2 Graphic management**

- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another win- dow, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESCmust close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window‚Äôs frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

**3 Map**

- The map has to be constructed with 3 components: **walls**, **collectibles**, and **free space**.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: **0** for an empty space,

**1** for a wall,

**C** for a collectible,

**E** for a map exit,

**P** for the player‚Äôs starting position.

Here is a simple valid map:



|1111111111111|
| - |
|10010000000C1|
|1000011111001|
|1P0011E000001|
|1111111111111|


- The map must contain at least **1 exit**, **1 collectible**, and **1 starting position**.
- The map must be rectangular.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it‚Äôs not, the program must return an error.
- You don‚Äôt have to check if there‚Äôs a valid path in the map.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.
- Another example of a minimal .ber map:



|1111111111111111111111111111111111|
| - |
|1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001|
|1010010100100000101001000000010101|
|1010010010101010001001000000010101|
|1P0000000C00C0000000000000000000C1|
|1111111111111111111111111111111111|
- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
