## üìê Introduction

‚Ä¢ Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.

‚Ä¢ Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

‚Ä¢ All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated.

‚Ä¢ If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

‚Ä¢ Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

‚Ä¢ To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h}.
Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.

‚Ä¢ If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project‚Äôs
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

‚Ä¢ We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won‚Äôt have to be submitted and won‚Äôt be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers‚Äô work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

‚Ä¢ Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded.
If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought‚Äôs grading, the evaluation will stop.

## üíæ Mandatory part


|**Program name**|pipex|
| - | - |
|**Turn in files**|Makefile, \*.h, \*.c|
|**Makefile**|NAME, all, clean, fclean, re|
|**Arguments**|file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2|
|**External functs.**|<p>- open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, access, dup, dup2, execve, exit, fork, pipe, unlink, wait, waitpid</p><p>- ft\_printf and any equivalent YOU coded</p>|
|**Libft authorized**|No|
|**Description**|This project is about handling pipes.|
Your program will be executed as follows:

./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2

It must take 4 arguments:

- file1 and file2 are **file names**.
- cmd1and cmd2are **shell commands** with their parameters. It must behave exactly the same as the shell command below:

$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2


**III.1 Examples**

$> ./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile

Should behave like: < infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile

$> ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile

Should behave like: < infile grep a1 | wc -w > outfile

**III.2 Requirements**

Your project must comply with the following rules:

- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not relink.
- You have to handle errors thoroughly. In no way your program should quit unex- pectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, and so forth).
- Your program mustn‚Äôt have **memory leaks**.
- If you have any doubt, handle the errors like the shell command:
- file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
